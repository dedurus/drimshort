Being faced with the new world order, the daily alterations imposed by the pandemic, and hence the inability of man to adapt to all invisible barriers and dangers, we were forced to choose the online edition as the safest option, which can be followed by everyone from 13-15 November on our website. We do not consider ourselves as (anti)heroes who will defy the reality, we are not the only festival that will oppose the virus, but for us maintaining the continuity of the festival is however a small but very precious victory, that will only allow the festival to grow and to become an inevitability, a mark and a need, having the reality of Struga collided with the film magic every year. ")]),a("p",[e._v("It’s worth mentioning how we managed to plan and direct another festival, that will gather the best short films from the past year in one place, carrying messages of life stories that represent struggles worth telling, from all around the world. At a time when distancing ourselves from one another means security and a way to fight the world pandemic, and physical closeness is merely a danger, art is obliged to connect the world on a higher level than the physical one, therefore creating a field of values that will freely ennoble people and try to fulfill their void. The art as a tremendous field, of course includes the film, as a medium through which we modulate our messages, wrapping them in stories, wrapping them  in newly created virtual worlds that will, for the umpteenth time, teach us to be human once again. As every year, our main focus is the short film form, providing it with the space it deserves, because it is direct and strong, and because it allows the film artists to appear on the big screen more often. ")]),a("p",[e._v('The time we live in shall not force us to easily reconcile with the new reality. The time we live in is however a consequence of the general world order in which we are being deeply involved. Once the virus will be overcome, it will be of great importance, whether we learn the lesson or simply throw the pandemic into the past, like every other forgotten crisis. Every film inevitably starts with the past, therefore whatever we manage to recognize in the characters, each of their action, each of their ventures, every success or defeat is indeed a consequence of their past. But by the end of the film, every well-built character grows, matures, changes, faces the past, so that he can step into the future. The past as well as the film contains a beginning, a culmination and an end.  And it is the confrontation with the past generally as a concept, both in the reality and in film, that is being the focus-theme of this year\'s edition of Drim Short. Hence the motto of the festival "The past has to end" comes into being.
