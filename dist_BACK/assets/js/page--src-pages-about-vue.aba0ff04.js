Struga as a city embodies a unique story, geographical position and a natural synergy; a place where art is born, lives and rests. Struga,the cradle of poetry and the most refined among all artists, poets, as well brings the film magic and leaves space to be a home, where the film authors will always return and be accepted as genuine friends. Our ambitious intention aims for Struga to be affirmed in the significant film core, to become a cultural crossroad, and for the festival to be established as a regional destination that greets film makers from North Macedonia, Serbia, Albania, Greece, Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, primarily through the regular edition of the festival, and hopefully in the foreseeable future to become a place for networking and collaboration, where film artists will have the opportunity to create, experience and result with new works. With the Drim Short, film festival  we maintain the culture continuity in Struga and bring the culture back to its institutions. With that, we aim to renew the habit of Struga citizens to visit  the cinema, or in other words, to recognize the cinema as an added social value, encouraging the culture institutions to provide a frequent and regular film program in our city.\n  ")]),t("p",[this._v("\n    The Drim Short Film Festival as a concept and idea was created to treat and promote  the form of short films only, aiming to actualize the short film as a serious artistic format. The short film is a medium through which film artists easily gain the opportunity to appear on the big screen, therefore creating new worlds in which everyone recognizes their hero and thematic value. The concept of short film contains the seriousness in the process of approaching and producing, that characterizes the art of film, using the film language under the pressure of time. But it also offers lightness with the clear and precise expression that immediately introduces us to the life-turmoil of the heroes and the antiheroes, so in a short period of time we come across the fate, perceive the message and realize the truth that the film story serves. At the same time, Drim Short aims to promote young filmmakers from North Macedonia, but also from all over Europe, who start their careers with short films and messages strong enough to announce their name to the public.\n  ")])])}),[],!1,null,"0d04f00f",null);t.default=o.exports}}]);
