        <p class="lead text-center text-white">What is it?</p>
        <p>TSFM Word-Frame North Macedonia is an intensive workshop aimed at guiding eight directors and/or
            screenwriters in the making of a short fiction or hybrid film (docu-fiction, creative documentary, animation
            with real elements, etc.). The workshop aims to provide participants with the basic knowledge and working
            tools useful for writing a script and realising a short film, i.e. those skills useful to start a profession
            in the film industry. Moreover the workshop aims to offer opportunities in order to increase their knowledge
            about the development of stories for short films, and the basics of production and distribution and about
            the festival circuit.
        </p>

        <p class="lead text-center text-white">Who?</p>
        <p>
            The workshop is open to all aspiring directors and/or screenwriters resident in North Macedonia, Serbia,
            Albania, Kosovo, Greece, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Croatia who have been working on a
            short film project in the early stages of development (synopsis, short treatment, starting idea). Candidates
            with previous cinematographic and/or artistic experience are also admitted to the workshop. The workshop
            will be held entirely in English.
        </p>

        <p class="lead text-center text-white">Where and When?</p>
        <p>

            following the health protocols in force at the time of the workshop. These protocols will be communicated to

        <p class="lead text-center text-white">Introduction</p>
        <p>
            TSFM Word-Frame is an intensive international training workshop aimed at short film directors and
            screenwriters, developed by Massimiliano Nardulli, Massimo D'orzi and Enrico Vannucci and promoted by TSFM -
            tsfm.centrodelcorto.it.
            Through both theoretical and practical training based on a successfully tested methodology, and under the
            guidance of the workshop’s tutors, eight selected filmmakers will be motivated to confront each other
            developing their respective short film projects over the course of five days.
        </p>

        <p class="lead text-center text-white">Methodology</p>
        <p>
            Said methodology is based on collective work aimed to develop projects and new ideas. A series of tools
            taught via the dialectical relationship installed with tutors and other students will teach filmmakers to
            recognize and enhance the core of their work. The production feasibility, artistic values and socio-cultural
            contexts of the projects will be highly taken into consideration during the phase of development.
        </p>

        <p>
            The workshop will also feature informative masterclasses that focus on the global short film industry —
            covering topics such as festivals, markets, distribution & sales companies, pitching sessions and the
            development of film dossiers.
            Our teaching methodology aims to strengthen the quality and originality of the short film format. We intend
            to nurture short film projects that are deeply rooted into the national and international production and
            distribution chains of value, while still exhibiting a surprising and unique cinematographic language.
        </p>

        <p>
            TSFM Word-Frame will happen over the course of a maximum ten workshops of which half will be set in Italy
            and the other half in five different European countries. An additional final workshop will be held in Italy
            during TSFM Vol. 7, towards the end of the Fall of 2022.
        </p>

        <p>
            Via specific calls for projects released for each session, tutors will select eight filmmakers to
            participate in each workshop. A maximum of ten participants, at least one for each stage, chosen by the
            tutors on the basis of their work and projects, will ultimately attend the final workshop during TSFM.
        </p>

        <p>
            This six-days long final session will focus on building production strategies for each short film project
            and will lead up to a pitching session and one-to-one meetings with producers and industry professionals. A
            prime objective of this final workshop is to create networks between Italian and European filmmakers coming
            from different backgrounds — nurtured by the tight collaboration among participants — and other film
            professionals via scheduled meetings.
        </p>

        <p>
            We strongly believe that international networking — also deeply rooted to peculiar production chains of
            value from several areas and regions in Europe — can bring huge benefits to participants, as TSFM Word-Frame
            will be facilitating and accelerating not only the production and realisation of their work-in-progress
            projects, but also the promotion through festivals and broadcasting & online circuits.
        </p>
